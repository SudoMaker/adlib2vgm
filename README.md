Converts file formats supported by AdPlug to VGM format.

## Notice
This tool is originally designed to work with the [RetroWave OPL3 Sound Card](https://www.tindie.com/products/sudomaker/retrowave-opl3-sound-card/).

Currently it doesn't produce files that's 100% compatible with the VGMPlay software.

## Why?
### Format
VGM is the next universal format for various vintage sound chips. It's ~~well~~ documented and extensible.

If one wants to build a player that uses/emulates these vintage sound chips, using VGM format will make things much easier.

### Programming Practises
It's almost impossible to directly integrate AdPlug into a modern C++ project that uses CMake & self-contained dependency management.

## Binary releases
See the [releases](https://github.com/SudoMaker/adlib2vgm/releases) section.

Currently built targets:
- Linux x86_64 (glibc 2.28+)
- Windows x86_64 (Windows 7+)


## Build requirements
- C++17 compatible compiler
- CMake 3.14+
- POSIX compatible environment
- zlib 1.3

Windows users please use WSL or Cygwin, or maybe try Linux a bit ;-)

## Build instructions

Compile:

```shell script
git clone https://github.com/SudoMaker/adlib2vgm
cd adlib2vgm
mkdir build
cd build
cmake -G 'Ninja' ..
ninja
```

Install:
